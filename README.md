This repository consists of:
- House price data extraction and cleaning - located in the main folder.
- Green space data analysis - 'green-spaces' folder.
- Transit station data analysis -'TTC_Files' folder.
- Safe injection sites and needle dropbox location data analysis - 'Injection Site EDA' folder.

The house price data is the base of all the analyses as all factors are being assessed against house prices. Outputs and codes from these notebooks were used in the notebooks for each factor analysis.

This house price data is located in the main repository and the relevant files have been copied to each sub folder for the different factors affecting house prices.

The notebook(s) for each folder are:

- green-spaces: green-space-analysis.ipynb

- TTC_Files: TTC_Lines.ipynb

- Injection-sites: 1) City of Toronto SIS and NDB Locations Web Scraping.ipynb
                 2) Injection Site EDA.ipynb
                 
The notebooks would be able to run without issue as all required files being called are located within the same sub folder.
